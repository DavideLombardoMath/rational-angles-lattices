==============================
Subsums for the ab=cd equation
Number of subsets with 5 elements: 56
Every subset I with |I| \geq 5 gives a finite quotient
For each such I, the quotient Z^3/M has exponent at most 1
If Z^3/M is finite, its exponent lies in the set { 1, 2, 3, 4 }


==============================
Subsums for the (3)+(2) equation
Number of subsets with 9 elements: 2002
Every subset I with |I| \geq 9 gives a finite quotient
For each such I, the quotient Z^3/M has exponent at most 1
If Z^3/M is finite, its exponent lies in the set { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8, 9, 10 }


==============================
Subsums for the (2)+(2)+(2) equation
Number of subsets with 10 elements: 8436285
Every subset I with |I| \geq 10 gives a finite quotient
For each such I, the quotient Z^3/M has exponent at most 2
If Z^3/M is finite, its exponent lies in the set { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26,

Description of the corresponding lattices:
Applying the automorphism sending zeta_n to zetan^3
leads to a geometrically valid configuration
The corresponding values of tau satisfy the equation

    1/2*(3*zetan^2 + 3*zetan)
Tau does not lie in the same cyclotomic field as x,y,z
The lattices corresponding to the two different values of tau are not homothetic
Lattices number 1 and 3 are homothetic
